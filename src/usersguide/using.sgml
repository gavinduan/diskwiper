<para>
After you installed the Diskwiper roll you can wipe a node disk by two means:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
        <para>
        Changing the membership of a node to Diskwiper, for example:
        <computeroutput>rocks set host membership nodename diskwiper</computeroutput>
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
        <para>
        Setting the attribute diskwiper to true for a particular node, for example:
	<computeroutput>rocks set host attr nodename diskwiper true</computeroutput>
	</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<para>
Afterward, it is necessary to reinstall the node.
</para>

<screen>
ssh nodename /boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart-pxe
</screen>

<para>

During the node re-installation the Diskwiper Roll will wipe all the
data from all the disks in the systems (using the command
<computeroutput>scrub</computeroutput>). When all the disks are wiped
the node will be powered off.
</para>

<para>
It is important to verify that all the disk have been succesfully wiped
looking in the <computeroutput>/var/log/messages</computeroutput> file
on the frontend. Each time a disk is wiped sucessfully it is reported
with a line similar to the following:
</para>

<screen>
Oct  3 21:24:05 nodename logger: nodename device /dev/sda wipe succeed
</screen>

<para>
If some problem occured during the wipe, instead of
<computeroutput>succeed</computeroutput> the message
will report <computeroutput>failed</computeroutput>.
</para>
